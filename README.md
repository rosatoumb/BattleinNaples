# Battle in Naples : IBM CAPSTONE PROJECT

## INTRO/ BUSINESS PROBLEMS

Naples is one of the best cities in Italy, but ror tourists, finding the right place to eat can be a challenge, though. German dishes include a lot of meat, often pork, which many people do not want to eat for health-related, religious, cultural or moral reasons. This is just one motive for giving tourists a good overview about what to eat where.

Thus, the goal I want to reach with this exercise is to give a simple recommendation to tourists in Naples: in which district of the city will you find a large number or even concentration of which types of restaurants? Where to eat Mediterranean food, where to find German food, where to get fast food? The target audience are foreign tourists.

## Description of the data
I will, as requested by the assignment task, use foursquare data about restaurants in Naples. I will use foursquare data such as the restaurant name, ID, location and category of food (vegetarian, Italian etc.).

Also, I will use the overview of districts(or quarters)/city parts of Naples from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarters_of_Naple

Here, you will find a table "Districts" which shows the nine city districts. I will use these districts and the data about restaurants in these districts from foursquare to show the density of restaurants in them.
